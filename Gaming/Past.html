                        From the earliest days of computers, people have found ways to play games on them. These early computer programmers were not just wasting time or looking for new ways to goof off. They had practical reasons to create games.
                        During the 1940s and 1950s, computers took up entire rooms and were so expensive that only universities and large companies could afford them. Most people had both a limited understanding of what these electronic behemoths were able to do and an unfamiliarity with the types of mathematical equations these machines were regularly programmed to compute. Games like tic-tac-toe or William Higginbotham’s 1958 Tennis for Two were excellent ways to attract public interest and support. As a bonus, computer programmers were able to learn from the creation of games as well because it allowed them to break away from the usual subroutines and challenge the computer’s capabilities.
                        
                <br><br>    
                        It was this mindset that led a group of MIT students during the 1960s to create one of the first and most ground-breaking computer games. Students Steve Russell and his friends were granted access to the school’s new PDP-1 computer providing they used it to create a demonstration program that (1) utilized as many of the computer’s resources as possible and “taxed those resources to the limit,” (2) remained interesting even after repeated viewings, which meant that each run needed to be slightly different and (3) was interactive. This led to a game called space war. It was a 2-player game.
                        Gaming has always been a taxing task for computers to run, games provided some of the earliest computers to be tested to their limits and to understand how they read programs. It was an amazing way to increase the general public’s interest in computers which was not a very well-known concept in its early days. More interest meant more funding and more people willing to learn about them.
                        
                        This was the reason why video games were built in the first place. But computers were still only limited to large corporations and a few colleges back then, so the normal public still did not have access to them.
Moving a decade later, in the 1960s, with the rise in television technology, a lot of people in America started investing in televisions. Televisions were used in viewing entertainment. But one engineer by the name of Ralph Baer had other very interesting ideas.
Ralph Baer worked for Sanders Associates, Inc. They made televisions. In 1966, Baer was convinced that televisions could be used for playing video games. Baer began to explore this idea. In 1967, assisted by Sanders’s technician Bob Tremblay, Baer created the first of several video game test units. Called TVG#1 or TV Game Unit #1, the device, when used with an alignment generator, produced a dot on the television screen that could be manually controlled by the user. Once Baer had established how it was possible to interact with the television set, he and his team were able to design and build increasingly sophisticated prototypes.
The Sanders corporation, seeing the progress, asked Baer to make the product commercially viable. After a lot of hard work and testing, in 1972, the first ever home console called the Magnavox Odyssey (nicknamed the brown box) came into being.
But it did not sell that well, it sold about 200,000 units, which counted as a failure. The reason being poor marketing on the corporations’ side making it look like a gimmick for the Magnavox TVs.
