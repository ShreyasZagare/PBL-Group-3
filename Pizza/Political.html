										<p>How, as cultural communities, do we interpret our social imaginary once the locus of our national customs, myths and markers is compromised? Since the 1980s, many theories mapping the modernity of nations and nationalism have been tabled, despite their ostensible ‘primordialism’. Perhaps most relevant to the pizza effect is that of ‘invented traditions’, introduced by Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger. <br><br>These ‘are responses to novel situations which take the form of reference to old situations, or which establish their own past’ explains Hobsbawm, adding ‘new traditions could be readily grafted on old ones … borrowing from the well-supplied warehouses of official ritual, symbolism and moral exhortation’. We might, then, consider the pizza effect to be one of many explanations behind the invention of traditions.

									<div class="span-3-25">
										<p>The two examples offered thus far show the plausible benignity of Bharati’s theory, which, in a period of global communications and easy travel, likely accounts for innumerable cross-cultural instances the world over. 
											However, the possibility of pizza effect-ed materials being gathered to summon widespread national consciousness–with the capacity to evolve into ‘hot’ nationalism–cannot be ignored.<br><br> As Hobsbawm argues, the ‘unprecedented’ theme of nationalism prior to the late 18th-century meant ‘that even historic continuity had to be invented’.
											In our case, this feasibly gives culturally transplanted phenomena a superficial antiquity, and the loyalty this entails, through ‘semi-fiction … forgery’. 
										</p>
									</div>
									
									<div class="span-3-25">
										<p>Connectedly, one might draw on Miroslav Hroch’s ‘phases of nationalism’, the first being a mass research of attributes attached to a group in order to promote awareness, identity and collectivisation. In recognising these concepts, not only can we understand why the pizza effect is conducive to the invention of tradition and the ‘ethnic entrepreneurs’ that encourage it, but also how re-enculturation might eventually contribute towards building more active and developed nationalist movements.<br><br>
											So far we have seen how the pizza effect is able to invent traditions and engender vigorous nationalism, and, where it has not, can at least emphasise ethnic particularities. Still, what about supra- or ‘postnationalism’? 
											</p>

										<p>In 2015, the ‘EU Pizza Effect’ project saw the collaboration of organisations from seven member states to host cookery workshops showcasing their national dishes. Attempting to illustrate the ‘blind acceptance of all things new and foreign’ amongst its constituent nations, the European Union heralded this sponsorship as unlocking ‘active social integration into the European community’. <br><br>Clearly such a commitment will require more than sharing Hungarian stuffed peppers, even if one overlooks the bloc’s interpretation of the pizza effect as diverging from Bharati’s. Conversely, re-enculturation’s transnational capability cannot be dismissed. Existing scholarship on the phenomenon, though rare, has catalogued its profound impact on spiritual movements without delineated territory or national culture, from Buddhism to Wahhabism to New Age Mayanism. Though my piece has attempted to redress this imbalance, the EU might simultaneously learn more from the pizza effect’s borderless potential.

										<p><h3>Case Study: Italy</h3>
											A nation's flag embodies a defining aspect of its identity. It could be related to geography (the rising sun in Japan), nature (the maple leaf of Canada or the cedar of Lebanon), religion (the Christian cross or the Islamic crescent and star), political ideology (the hammer and sickle) or mythology (the Welsh dragon).
											In a new book on flags, A Flag Worth Dying For: The Power and Politics of National Symbols, Tim Marshall explores how a "piece of coloured cloth" can arouse profound emotions of loyalty, love and pride in the breasts of its citizens.
											<br><br>But of all the hundreds of flags that Marshall encounters, there is only one whose exuberant colours effortlessly evoke the nation's delicious cuisine: the Italian flag.
Italians offer various unofficial explanations for the flag's colors, says Marshall. "Red, the usual blood spilled for independence; green for the verdant landscape; and white for the Alps." But, he continues, "meaning lies in the eye of the beholder, and this writer beholds avocado, mozzarella cheese (buffalo, naturally), and tomatoes. Salute!"
