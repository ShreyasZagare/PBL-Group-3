										<p>In this ever changing economy the supply and demand for almost all products is 
											constantly changing. Something that has stayed strong and helped the economy 
											tremendously is the pizza industry. The pizza business is a 40 billion dollar industry when 
											measured by sales per year. It makes up 17% of all restaurants in the US. <br><br>
											 
											By being the number 5 comfort food in America, pizza companies have always been 
											able to provide an enjoyable product to consumers. These companies know how to get 
											customers, and one way they’re doing that is by offering deals. When Pizza Hut started 
											offering a $10 pizza with up to three toppings, their business went up 8%. Domino’s did a 
											similar thing and started offering 2 medium pizzas for $5.99 each and then their sales 
											jumped 11.7%. Each company had to make a trade off by creating money saving deals. 
											</p>

									<div class="span-3-25">
										<p>They could either have lower prices and more customers, or higher prices with less 
											customers. When they decided to make these deals the opportunity cost was more profit 
											from each single order, but with these new prices will come more customers meaning that 
											the benefits will outweigh the cost. The reason sales went up after cheap deals were 
											offered is because pizza is an elastic good, meaning that the lower the price is, the higher 
											the demand will be and the more customers will want. 
											<br><br> According to FranchiseHelp, 
											Americans eat approximately 100 acres of pizza a day. That’s 350 slices per second! Not 
											only that, but the pizza demographic is huge; 93% of Americans eat at least 1 pizza per 
											month. Even with all of those people already buying pizza, 41% of people say that they’re 
											not getting takeout or delivery as much as they would like to. About ¼ of people will also 
											say that technology will play a big role when choosing where they buy their food. </p>
									</div>


									<div class="span-3-25">
										<p>For these 
											reason many pizza chains now have online options were people can order their takeout 
											from their computer. Domino’s Pizza CEO, Patrick Doyle, says that 45% of their business is 
											online, and that digital ordering is also more profitable. When people order online they 
											usually get more and have a higher satisfaction.
