										<p><h3>Case Study: Domino’s </h3>
											Domino’s, the international pizza chain, went from near bankruptcy to tech innovator with one question: What if a customer could browse for, order and pay for a pizza—all while waiting at a stoplight?<br><br>
											Domino’s was, famously, a brick-and-mortar pizza place with a promise to deliver pizzas in “30 minutes or less.” That tactic worked until competitors started beating them at their own game. Domino’s needed an edge.
											</p>
									</div>

									<div class="span-3-25">
										<p>In 2011, Domino’s then-CEO Patrick Doyle tasked his IT team with a seemingly impossible ask: Make it as easy and efficient as possible for any customer with a smartphone to order a pizza in the 17 seconds it takes for a light to turn green. The IT team answered the call with a “build and order your own pizza” app. Today, “Domino's customers are now more likely to order from a digital platform, such as the chain's iPad app, than they are to order via phone,” according to Nation's Restaurant News (NRN). <br><br>
											And, thanks to their dedication to digital-first innovations like this, Domino’s grew from pizza place to tech titan.
											</p>
									</div>
									
									<div class="span-3-25">
										<p>Before e-bikes and driverless delivery, third-party services like DoorDash and UberEats were coming for Domino’s delivery business. According to TechCrunch, “Domino’s could never offer enough menu options to compete with DoorDash or UberEats, but it can compete on service and delivery times.” Especially now that the majority of restaurants offer delivery, Domino’s is willing to get creative to stay ahead of the competition.<br><br>
											That creativity is especially important now that consumer interest in takeout and delivery has seen a 148 percent increase compared to level before the pandemic, according to Yelp data.
											</p>
									</div>
									
									<div class="span-3-25">
										<p>So, Dominos invested in two digital-first innovations to make the delivery process smoother (and to stay ahead of the competition): delivery via autonomous vehicle and delivery via electric bike. Those innovations resulted in 2019 digital sales of “more than half of all global retail sales.” <br><br>
											Domino’s partnered with Ford to launch autonomous (driverless) delivery in 2019. The car, called Nuro R2, travels at 25 miles per hour to designated delivery zones in Houston, Texas. Customers who opt for autonomous delivery will be issued a code to enter into a screen on the outside of the vehicle to receive their order.
											</p>
									</div>

									<div class="span-3-25">
										<p>Nuro is Domino’s second shot at an autonomous delivery system—in 2017, it tested driverless deliveries in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where Domino’s is headquartered, via a modified Ford Fusion. That experiment allowed for a safety driver to ride along, but the Nuro has no room for humans; one thing both companies will continue to iterate on in order for Nuro deliveries to be economic, scalable and successful.<br><br>
											Over time, driverless vehicles will be less expensive to run than deliveries made via a passenger vehicle. Kroger, the grocery chain, is also testing and seeing success with Nuro-powered grocery delivery in Arizona and Texas. 
											</p>
									</div>

									<div class="span-3-25">
										<p>Domino’s also partnered with Rad Power Bikes in 2019 to launch delivery by e-bike. One bike can hold 12 large pizzas, and it tops out at 20 assisted miles per hour. In some markets, like Seattle, bike delivery mitigates parking issues—and electric assistance helps couriers speed-up the process. <br><br>
											In a press release, Greg Keller, Seattle Domino's franchisee, said, "While delivery on a traditional bike solved many of our traffic and parking issues, the hills in Seattle were tough on even our best cyclists. E-bikes were a game-changer for us, and we've been delivering with them for three years now. We have been able to save money, provide better service, increase hiring and maintain a happy workforce." <br><br>
											Customers are able to track their Nuro or e-bike delivery through the Domino’s app, just like they would with any other food-delivery app. <br><br>
